%% 3.6.2 - get a conventional differentiator of length 23 by following Sec. 3.3

fs = 512;
Ts = 1/fs;
N = 23;
M = (N-1)/2;
n = 1:1:M;
h = cos(n*pi)./(Ts*n); % compute desired impulse response using (3.5)
h = [-fliplr(h) 0 h]; % compute desired impulse response using (3.4)
win = hamming(N); % construct 41-point Hamming window
h_diff = win(:).*h(:); % generate the impulse response of the differentiator

% We now apply the differentiator to the position signal s[n] by discrete convolution:
sw = conv(h_diff, s); % perform digital differentiation by discrete convolution
s_diff = sw(12:1035); % reduce the output length to 1024
